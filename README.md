# NVSim

A program to simulate the resonance of nitrogen-vacancy centers and compare them with experimental ODMR measurements.
It can find the orientation of the NV centers and the linear dependence of the magnetic field (i.e. by supplying Hall effect sensor voltages)
using frequency sweeps recorded at different magnetic fields.
