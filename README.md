# NVSim

A program to simulate the resonance of nitrogen-vacancy centers and compare them with experimental ODMR measurements.
It can find the orientation of the NV centers and the magnetic field strength using a single microwave frequency sweep.

The project currently consists of a number of Pluto Notebooks for interactive use, the most important one being [Iterative.jl](Notebooks/Iterative/Iterative.jl) which contains the iterative algorithm.
